# Leads_Score_Case_Study
## Problem Statement
An X Education need help to select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires us to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

### Goals of the Case Study:
- To build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads.
- To adjust if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well.

### Steps followed:
- Reading and Cleaning of the Data Frame
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Dummy variables creation
- Splitting the Data set for Train-Test 
- Model Building
- Model Prediction 
- Model Evaluation
- ROC Curve
- Precision Recall
